# Saucedemo Automation Testing Project (Playwright)

📌 Project Overview

This project contains automated test scenarios for the website:
SauceDemo Website: https://www.saucedemo.com/

The automation is implemented using Playwright with JavaScript and follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better readability, reusability, and maintainability.

The project includes three test scenarios (Q1, Q2, Q3) as required in the assessment and supports:

Running tests individually

Running all tests together in sequential order

Generating Allure reports after every execution

🛠️ Technology Stack

Language: JavaScript

Automation Framework: Playwright

▶️ How to Install Dependencies

Run this command once after cloning the repository: npm install

▶️ How to Run Test Scenarios
🔹 Run All Tests Together (Sequentially) : npx playwright test

All tests (Q1, Q2, Q3) run one after another because workers: 1 is set in playwright.config.js.

🔹 Run Tests Individually

*** Run Q1 only

npx playwright test tests/Q1-saucedemo.spec.js

*** Run Q2 only

npx playwright test tests/Q2-saucedemo.spec.js

*** Run Q3 only

npx playwright test tests/Q3-saucedemo.spec.js

🔁 Sequential Execution Configuration

Sequential execution is controlled from playwright.config.js:

workers: 1

This ensures:

Q1 → Q2 → Q3 run in order

No parallel execution

📊 Allure Report Generation
✅ Configuration

Allure reporting is enabled in playwright.config.js:
reporter: [
  ['list'],
  ['allure-playwright']
]

▶️ How Allure Report Is Generated

After every test execution, Playwright automatically creates Allure result files in:
allure-results/

▶️ How to View Allure Report

*** Run this command in terminal after test execution: npx allure serve allure-results

This will:

Generate the Allure HTML report

Open it automatically in the browser

⚠️ Note:
The Allure report is generated after execution, not during test runtime.

📋 Terminal Test Result Output

After execution, Playwright shows results like:

Running 3 tests using 1 worker
✓ Q1 passed
✓ Q2 passed
✓ Q3 passed

This confirms:

Tests ran sequentially

All scenarios executed successfully.
